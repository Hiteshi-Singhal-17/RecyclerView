## Introduction
Companies demonstrating the use of RecyclerView to layout elements with a LinearLayoutManager.

RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large sets of data. One supply the data and define how each item looks, and the RecyclerView library dynamically creates the elements when they're needed. As the name implies, RecyclerView recycles those individual elements. When an item scrolls off the screen, RecyclerView doesn't destroy its view. Instead, RecyclerView reuses the view for new items that have scrolled onscreen. This reuse vastly improves performance, improving your app's responsiveness and reducing power consumption.
